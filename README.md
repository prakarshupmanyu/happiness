# happiness
Small analysis of how peoples happiness change over time and what it could mean to them.

## Data Source
https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/

This dataset was created by asking a set of workers for the Mechanical Turk to recall happy moments from their life in the last 24 hours to 3 months. The happy moments are listed as English sentences along with the data about the worker like age, gender, etc.

## Analysis

I was reading the happy moments and was trying to visualize the kind of person that might have written it by going through the worker information and began to see a trend as people age. I noticed that younger people recalled more happy moments from their achievements as opposed to middle-aged people who recalled more happy moments from their time spent with their significant other or family. It could tell us how younger people might not value relationships with friends and family that much when answering "What made you happy?".

Could this be a reason for rising depression and suicide rates among teenagers? 
What if their failure to recognize happy moments causes them temper problems or to commit crimes? Statistics do show that younger people are more likely to commit a crime.

I establish that the number of males and females asked to gather this data is almost same (females slightly more than males). But when I try to check the number of happy instances reported by them for each happiness category, I see the trends in what counts as making a male happy vs a woman happy. I create 7 plots, one for each category. Females only outnumbered males (only by a slight margin) when reporting happy instances for "affection" category. That is it. For all other categories, males reported way more instances than females on average. So we know the females, put affection (from relationships and family) more than any other kind of happiness, or at least they eagerly recall it when asked. This kind of was expected. But looking at other category counts raised questions in my head. For example when I look "exercise", males instances reported being happy due to exercise by more than double than that reported by females. This could mean that either males workout more than females on average or males feel better after a workout as compared to females. But then working out should lead to healthier and longer life, so how do women outlive men. Is it because they value "affection" more? Does "affection" type of happiness is more important than "exercise" kind of happiness? This is an interesting analysis.
